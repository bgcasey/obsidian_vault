## Vault Structure

**Periodic notes**: Daily, weekly, and monthly notes.

Organized using the  **PARA** method:
- **Projects** for action focused work with deadlines, 
- **Areas** for ongoing work
- **Resources** for all reference materials
- **Archive** for completed work

Various markdown note templates for [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

The templates require the following obsidian community plugins:
- Tasks
- Dataview

The templates can be applied to new markdown files using the Templater community plugin.
